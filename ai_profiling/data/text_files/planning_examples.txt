Example #1
CONTEXT
The system has actions A, B, C, D, and E.
Action D has input parameter z and it outputs variables u and aa. To execute action D, variable z must be known. After executing action D, variables u and aa are known.
Action B outputs variable aa. Action B can be executed without knowing the value of any variable. After executing action B, variable aa is known.
Action A has input parameters cc and aa and it outputs variable bb. To execute action A, variables cc and aa must be known. After executing action A, variable bb is known.
Action E has input parameters x and y and it outputs variable bb. To execute action E, variables x and y must be known. After executing action E, variable bb is known.
Action C has input parameter bb. To execute action C, variable bb must be known.
Values are available already for variable cc.
Action map is used when a value for one variable can be used for another variable.
Action map can determine the value of variable cc from variable bb.
The system has action ask. Action ask lets the system ask the user about the value of any variable unless that variable is explicitly marked as cannot be acquired from the user. Action ask is less preferred than acquiring the value of a variable through other actions.
Variables aa, u, and z cannot be acquired by asking the user.
Variables bb, cc, x, and y can be acquired by asking the user.
The goal of the system is to execute actions E and C.
INSTRUCTION
Develop a concise plan to achieve the goals. The shorter plan is preferable. A plan consists of individual actions, each represented by its outputs and an action name followed by its parameters in parentheses (e.g., outputs = <action-name>(<parameters>). When it becomes impossible to achieve the objectives, the appropriate course of action should be considered as 'no plan'
PLAN EXPLANATION
0. Acquire the value of y by asking the user. y is required later by action E.
1. Acquire the value of x by asking the user. x is required later by action E.
2. Execute action E with x and y as inputs. This will result in acquiring bb. bb is required later by action C. Since executing E was a goal of this plan, return the results of E(x, y) to the user.
3. Execute action C with bb as input. Since executing C was a goal of this plan, return the results of C(bb) to the user.
PLAN
[0] ask(y)
[1] ask(x)
[2] bb = E(x, y)
[3] C(bb)
