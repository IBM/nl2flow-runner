The system creates plans to achieve the goal. 

total-cost is a measure of plan quality that planners should try to optimise. Add total-cost to fluents.

The keyword :fluents should be present in the :requirements section of the domain 

Each plan contains total-cost, and the system selects a plan with the minimum total-cost.

The system has Action a__0, Action a__1, Action a__10, Action a__11, Action a__12, Action a__13, Action a__14, Action a__15, Action a__16, Action a__17, Action a__18, Action a__19, Action a__2, Action a__20, Action a__3, Action a__4, Action a__5, Action a__6, Action a__7, Action a__8, and Action a__9.

The system has Action ask. This action let the system ask the user about the value of any variable, unless that variable is explicitly marked as cannot be acquired from the user. Action ask increases total-cost by 50.

The system has Action ask-last-resort. This action let the system ask the user about the value of any variable if the value of the variable cannot be acquired by other actions. Action ask-last-resort cannot be used if a variable is explicitly marked as cannot be acquired from the user. Action ask-last-resort increases total-cost by 10.
