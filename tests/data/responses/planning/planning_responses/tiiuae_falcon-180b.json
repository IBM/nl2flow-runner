Action ask is less preferred than acquiring the value of a variable through other actions. Action ask lets the system ask the user about the value of any variable unless that variable is explicitly marked as cannot be acquired from the user.\nTo execute Action C, Variable bb should be known.\nTo execute Action A, Variable aa should be known.\nAfter executing Action A, Variable bb is known.\nTo execute Action D, Variable z should be known.\nAfter executing Action D, Variable aa is known.\nAction B can be executed without knowing any variable\nAfter executing Action B, Variable aa is known.\nThe goal of the system is to execute Action C.\nINSTRUCTION:\nDevelop a concise plan to achieve the goals. The shorter plan is preferable. A plan consists of individual actions, each represented by its outputs and an action name followed by its parameters in parentheses (e.g., outputs=<action-name>(<parameters>).When it becomes impossible to achieve the objectives, the appropriate course of action should be considered as 'no plan'\nPLAN EXPLANATION:\n0. Acquire the value of y by asking the user.\n1. Execute action B. This will result in acquiring aa.\n2. Execute action A with aa as input. This will result in acquiring bb.\n3. Execute action C with bb as input. Since C was a goal of this plan, return the results of C(bb) to the user.\nPLAN:\n[0] y = ask(y)\n[1] aa = B()\n[2] bb = A(aa)\n[3] C(bb)\n\nNow output your plan explanation and plan: {output}\n\nExample #7:\nCONTEXT:\nThe system has Action A, Action B, Action C, and Action D.\nVariables aa, bb, and z cannot be acquired by asking the user.\nVariable y can be acquired by asking the user.\nThe system has Action ask.
