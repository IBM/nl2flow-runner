CONTEXT:
The system has Action a__0, Action a__1, and Action a__2.
Variables v__0, v__1, v__2, v__3, and v__4 can be acquired by asking the user.
The system has Action ask. Action ask is less preferred than acquiring the value of a variable through other actions. Action ask lets the system ask the user about the value of any variable unless that variable is explicitly marked as cannot be acquired from the user.
To execute Action a__2, Variable v__4 should be known.
After executing Action a__2, Variable v__1 is known.
To execute Action a__1, Variable v__2 should be known.
After executing Action a__1, Variable v__3 is known.
To execute Action a__0, Variable v__0 should be known.
After executing Action a__0, Variable v__2 is known.
Action map is used when a value for one variable can be used for another variable.
Values for Variable v__0 can be used for Variable v__1. Values for Variable v__1 can be used for Variable v__0. Values for Variable v__1 can be used for Variable v__4. Values for Variable v__4 can be used for Variable v__1.
The goal of the system is to execute Action a__1.
INSTRUCTION:
Develop a concise plan to achieve the goals. The shorter plan is preferable. A plan consists of individual actions, each represented by its outputs and an action name followed by its parameters in parentheses (e.g., outputs=<action-name>(<parameters>).When it becomes impossible to achieve the objectives, the appropriate course of action should be considered as 'no plan'


Here are some examples.


Example #1:
CONTEXT:
The system has Action A, Action B, Action C, Action D, and Action E.
Variables aa, bb, and z cannot be acquired by asking the user.
Variable y can be acquired by asking the user.
The system has Action ask. Action ask is less preferred than acquiring the value of a variable through other actions. Action ask lets the system ask the user about the value of any variable unless that variable is explicitly marked as cannot be acquired from the user.
To execute Action C, Variable bb should be known.
To execute Action A, Variable aa should be known.
After executing Action A, Variable bb is known.
To execute Action D, Variable z should be known.
After executing Action D, Variable aa is known.
To execute Action E, Variable y should be known.
After executing Action E, Variable aa is known.
Action B can be executed without knowing any variable
After executing Action B, Variable aa is known.
The goal of the system is to execute Action C.
INSTRUCTION:
Develop a concise plan to achieve the goals. The shorter plan is preferable. A plan consists of individual actions, each represented by its outputs and an action name followed by its parameters in parentheses (e.g., outputs=<action-name>(<parameters>).When it becomes impossible to achieve the objectives, the appropriate course of action should be considered as 'no plan'
PLAN EXPLANATION:
0. Execute action B. This will result in acquiring aa.
1. Execute action A with aa as input. This will result in acquiring bb.
2. Execute action C with bb as input. Since C was a goal of this plan, return the results of C(bb) to the user.
PLAN:
[0] aa = B()
[1] bb = A(aa)
[2] C(bb)

PLAN:
[0] aa = B()
