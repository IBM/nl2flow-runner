Yes, I know Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL). PDDL is a language used to describe planning problems in the field of artificial intelligence. It consists of two parts: the domain description, which defines the actions and predicates, and the problem description, which defines the initial state and the goal state.

Here's a simple example of a PDDL domain and problem for the classic "block world" problem:

Domain description (blocksworld_domain.pddl):

```
(define (domain blocksworld)
  (:requirements :strips :typing)
  (:types block)
  (:predicates
    (on ?x - block ?y - block)
    (ontable ?x - block)
    (clear ?x - block)
    (handempty)
    (holding ?x - block)
  )

  (:action pick-up
    :parameters (?x - block)
    :precondition (and (clear ?x) (ontable ?x) (handempty))
    :effect (and
              (not (ontable ?x))
              (not (clear ?x))
              (not (handempty))
              (holding ?x)
            )
  )

  (:action put-down
    :parameters (?x - block)
    :precondition (holding ?x)
    :effect (and
              (ontable ?x)
              (clear ?x)
              (handempty)
              (not (holding ?x))
            )
  )

  (:action stack
    :parameters (?x - block ?y - block)
    :precondition (and (holding ?x) (clear ?y))
    :effect (and
              (not (holding ?x))
              (not (clear ?y))
              (clear ?x)
              (handempty)
              (on ?x ?y)
            )
  )

  (:action unstack
    :parameters (?x - block ?y - block)
    :precondition (and (on ?x ?y) (clear ?x) (handempty))
    :effect (and
              (holding ?x)
              (clear ?y)
              (not (on ?x ?y))
              (not (clear ?x))
              (not (handempty))
            )
  )
)
```

Problem description (blocksworld_problem.pddl):

```
(define (problem blocksworld-problem)
  (:domain blocksworld)
  (:objects a b c - block)
  (:init
    (ontable a)
    (ontable b)
    (ontable c)
    (clear a)
    (clear b)
    (clear c)
    (handempty)
  )
  (:goal (and
           (on a b)
           (on b c)
         ))
)
```

In this example, the domain describes the actions (pick-up, put-down, stack, unstack) and predicates (on, ontable, clear, handempty, holding) for a block world problem. The problem description defines the initial state (three blocks on the table, all clear, and an empty hand) and the goal state (block A on block B, and block B on block C).
